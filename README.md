# Node-Project-Outline

<!-- Create a repo with a readme that:
 * outlines the steps for building a new Node/npm project refer to the notes on the Node, Node Modules, and Node packages
 * outlines the steps for cloning down and setting up a repo that uses node packages (edited)  -->

## Building NEW Node
1. When installing an npm you'll have to follow their download/install steps
1. Install using your terminal 'npm i {dependency name}'
1. Once installed npm of your choice you will open it on your code editor
1. you should see a folder called "node modules", if present you will add a '.gitignore' file to ensure github doesnt store the large library. Add "node_modules" to it. 
1. node {file name}.js to run it 

## Pre-Bulit
1. since "node_modules" already installed you will have to access your terminal and run "npm i" to install dependencies.
